Roslyn-CSharp-Sample-Editor-2013-03
===================================

A WinForms C# source code editor demonstrates using Roslyn to parse C# syntax and highlight diagnostic messages.

This sample was cobbled together during the March Meetup session themed "Microsoft Roslyn" of the Toronto .NET Hackers http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-dotNET-Hackers/

The purpose of the meetup session was to discover Roslyn technology.  This code is based on the Sept 2012 CTP release.

Platform: Visual Studio 2012, .NET 4.5, Console/WinForms hybrid app, Roslyn Sept 2012 CTP acquired through NuGet.
